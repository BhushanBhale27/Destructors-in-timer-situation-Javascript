class MyObject {
  constructor() {
    this.timer = setInterval(...);
  }
  
  stopTimer() {
    clearInterval(this.timer);
  }
}

let obj = new MyObject();

// ...

obj.stopTimer();
obj = null;



//By explicitly stopping the timer and setting the obj variable to null, 
//you can ensure that the resources held by the MyObject instance are released.

//Note that in practice, you usually don't need to worry about releasing resources in JavaScript, 
//as the garbage collector will automatically reclaim the memory used by objects that are no longer needed.
